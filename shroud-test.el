;; 1. handle blocking, evertime shroud--run is called Emacs could hang. TODO
;; the blocking situation: anytimo shroud--run is called, the process
;; may continue immediately if the GPG-agent is already authorised,
;; otherwise it may prompt for a password. but wait you are already
;; in a process, so you can't enter the password until you kill the
;; current process, and try again.

;;; 2. logo TODO
;;; 3. Auth-source backend for shroud TODO
;;; 4. shroud--hide TODO
;;; 5. shroud--hide-edit TODO
;;; 6. shroud--show --clipboard TODO
