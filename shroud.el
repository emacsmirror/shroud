;;; Commentary:
;;  Shroud is a password manager written in Guile which uses GnuPG in
;;  the backend.  See Shroud's website at
;;  https://dthompson.us/projects/shroud.html.  This package is an
;;  Emacs interface to Shroud using the Buffers User Interface
;;  library.
;;
;;  Shroud stores secrets as a plain text encrypted using
;;  GnuPG.  Particularly, in Lisp's S-expressions, in a form of
;;  associaton lists.  This provides the dual benefit that, the file is
;;  trivial to parse by machine, yet at the same time, is perfectly
;;  readable/editable by a human.
;;
;;  You can view, copy and edit secrets from Emacs.
;;
;;  Shroud's configuration options can be changed in the $HOME/.shroud
;;  file.  The default database is located in ~/.config/shroud/db.gpg.
;;
;;  To run M-x Shroud
;;
;;  However, Emacs-shroud also includes an elisp implementation of
;;  Shroud.  So you can begin using shroud without installing any
;;  external packages.  It can be configured to use the same defaults
;;  as Shroud like so.
;;
;;  #start ~/.emacs
;;    (setq shroud-el--database-file "~/.config/shroud/db.gpg")
;;    (setq shroud-el--config-file "~/.shroud")
;;    (setq shroud-el--gpg-key "A1761FE275883XXX")
;;  #end
;;
;;  This bit will pick between shroud(if you have installed it) or
;;  shroud-el.
;;
;;  #start ~/.emacs
;;    (shroud--init)
;;  #end
;;
;;  If gpg-key is not set and no configuration file is found Shroud
;;  may prompt you to choose a key each time you edit the database.
;;
;;  Sample Shroud Config
;;  #start ~/.shroud
;;    '((user-id . "AAOEUOEUP12323"))
;;  #end

;;  Sample Shroud Database
;;  #start ~/.config/shroud/db.gpg
;;    (((id . "my-bank") (contents  ("password" . "hackme") ("username" . "pwned") ...)) ...)
;;  #end
