;;; So, we have most of the commands that we will need to use bound to
;;; very friendly elisp functions. Notably missing is clipboard clear
;;; functionality.

;;; However, since I am already depending on shroud, it's better to
;;; slowly improve upon the broken application rather wait for myself
;;; to get the motivation(tm) to do it properly.

;;; I like the popup buffer UI a lot. I think a good UI would still be
;;; a helm UI but i still don't fully understand how it might work.

;;; Let's implement what we know already, We need a popup buffer which
;;; will show the available entries in shroud.  First course of
;;; action, define a procedure to output all shroud entries in a new
;;; buffer. Then, We will have a shroud-minor-mode-map we will add the
;;; keybindings to, so that we can quickly execute commands on
;;; entries. Commands like adding password, url, or either username to
;;; the kill-ring.

;;; Minor mode map will contain the keyboard shortcuts for
;;; `shroud-minor-mode'.It may not be necessary after we have a better
;;; Interface like BUI.
;;; This procedure prints the available entries in shroud in a split
;;; window.  The ad-hoc buffer interface we created earlier is not
;;; sufficient, it uses up too much space, messes up the previous
;;; window layout. We'd like to use something more convenient, and at
;;; the same time, avoid the work that comes with it. The author of
;;; this package is already familiar with Buffer User Interface (BUI)
;;; used in guix.el. So, it would be a fine first choice. We want a
;;; buffer to display the available password entries, and though, bui
;;; should provide us to display more details, for the privacy context
;;; of our application, we'd like to only show the Title, and perhaps
;;; the URL? Depending on how risky you are feeling, you could display
;;; even emails/username(!) for peek-over-the-shoulder security
;;; attacks. But make no mistake, this package is by no means secure,
;;; as it stores the password as plain string in the kill
;;; ring. Lazy...  err, lack of incentive.

;;; Load the bui library

;;; Hug it, I'll drop the nly/ prefix, it just seems silly now.
;;; The entry point to the shroud BUI.
;;; Let's just read directly from the db.gpg file using elisp

;;; Alright, so it appears shroud is very limited in terms of
;;; functionality and i can probably do much better if i simply use
;;; the elisp features to read and parse the file. Shroud provides
;;; another interface to the database, which then makes three
;;; interfaces, plain text; after decryption, shroud cli, shroud.el,
;;; and pure elisp interface. At this point only the data structure is
;;; important.  So, emacs has features to decrypt a file, decrypt
;;; buffers and whatnot. I have a feeling this is also going to be a
;;; bit ad-hoc, which scares me. Ad-hoc code is never portable or
;;; doesnt last as long. Nevertheless it's much better than limiting
;;; myself to the very limited cli interface, through which all elisp
;;; code has to go anyway. Alternatively can i use a guile daemon?

;;; Elisp reader for shroud db.gpg
;; Individually reading entries is painfully slow
