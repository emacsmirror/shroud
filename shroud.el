;;; So, we have most of the commands that we will need to use bound to
;;; very friendly elisp functions. Notably missing is clipboard clear
;;; functionality.

;;; However, since I am already depending on shroud, it's better to
;;; slowly improve upon the broken application rather wait for myself
;;; to get the motivation(tm) to do it properly.

;;; I like the popup buffer UI a lot. I think a good UI would still be
;;; a helm UI but i still don't fully understand how it might work.

;;; Let's implement what we know already, We need a popup buffer which
;;; will show the available entries in shroud.  First course of
;;; action, define a procedure to output all shroud entries in a new
;;; buffer. Then, We will have a shroud-minor-mode-map we will add the
;;; keybindings to, so that we can quickly execute commands on
;;; entries. Commands like adding password, url, or either username to
;;; the kill-ring.

;;; Minor mode map will contain the keyboard shortcuts for shroud-minor-mode.
